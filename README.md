# autoPublisher
This is a github action to automate the publishing of updates to apps you own in microsoft store.

Dont mess with applicationpackages, listings>..>images handled automatically.


exe stuff   -- need a exe creds
<!-- generalize for various listings --done -->
Use of old packages? --- different versions
other complexities? flights, add-ons etc --flights require atleast one sub

something about Platform overrides
Validation of json

Complete support for flights add-ons etc
1.	Use internal apis to publish first time
2.  Package the msix, check consistency of metadata with msix if overlap
3.	Pdp preview website

2.  setup sdk, then package but needs correct format, is this a impactful direction?
